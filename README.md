# customer-churn-prediction-model
Problem Statement:
Customer churn is an issue for businesses that rely on long-term customer engagement. Predicting
whether a customer will stop using a service allows companies to implement proactive strategies to
retain customers. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can classify
customers as likely to churn or not based on historical data.

Dataset:
I will use the 'customer_churn.csv' dataset provided. This dataset contains customer information,
service usage details, types of subscriptions/contracts, etc., which will serve as features for our
predictive model.

Methodology:
I will explore multiple approaches for predicting customer churn, including but not limited to:
1. Supervised Machine Learning Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests

2. Feature Engineering and Selection:
- Identifying key factors that contribute to churn, such as contract length, monthly
charges, etc.

3. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.
- Normalizing or standardizing numerical features if needed.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
